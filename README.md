# CHESS

This is an old project of mine, <br />
Which I wrote in 2019 and refactored at 2023 (watch for commits) <br />
I only wrote the C++ part of this project (chess engine) and modified a bit the C# (chess graphics) which was copied

# How to play

Simply git-clone, open the solution using visual studio, build the solution and run the chess-engine executable <br />
Note for the Dragon piece! It can move like Queen or like a Knight, and is able to fly over other pieces!
